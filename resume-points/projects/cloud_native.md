project_name: "Cloud-Native CI/CD & Infrastructure Platform on AWS EKS"
---

- Developed an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline to containerize and deploy a Spring Boot service to AWS EKS (K8s v1.28) using Docker → ECR (scan-on-push), Terraform-based IaC, and Helm-driven releases across dev/staging/prod with autoscaling and environment isolation. [AWS EKS, Docker, Terraform, Helm, CI/CD]
- Enforced delivery controls including SonarQube quality gates, Trivy image scanning, manual approvals, and healthcheck–driven rollback using Kubernetes probes and resource limits to ensure secure, reliable deployments. [SonarQube, Trivy, Kubernetes Probes]
